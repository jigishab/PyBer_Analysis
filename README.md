## PyBer Summary

This explains the summary of the ride sharing data by city type. It summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
The following are the three recommendations:
- In the beginning of March, there are less rides in Suburban area than in Urban area. If suburban driver drives in Urban area, their earnings may increase.
- Rural drivers earn less beginning April. If they drive in Urban or Suburban area, their earning may increase.
- Even though average fare per ride for Rural drivers is high, they are not earning as much as Urban or Suburban drivers. One of the suggestion is to increase Rural fare further to help them come closer to other city types.
